Description: Implements Key Feature (KF) analysis (Egbert and Biber, 2023) for identifying 		lexico-grammatical features that distinguish target corpus and reference corpus. Given 		two files of normalized feature rates (rows = texts; columns = features), the package 		computes means, standard deviations, pooled SD, and Cohen's d per feature, and 			visualizes d with a lollipop plot.
